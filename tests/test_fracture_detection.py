"""Tests for the multiâ€‘scale fracture detection algorithm.

The detection is evaluated on synthetic volumes containing a number of
planar fractures.  The algorithm should produce a fracture map that
correlates with the ground truth.  We do not expect perfect segmentation
because the simulated fractures may be partly occluded by noise and
artefacts, but the F1 score should exceed a baseline threshold and the
mean squared error should be reasonable.
