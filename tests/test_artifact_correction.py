"""Tests for beam hardening and ring artefact correction.

These tests create synthetic volumes containing only artefacts (no fractures)
and verify that the correction functions reduce the noise level and improve
similarity to the groundâ€‘truth data.  The SNR is used as a quantitative
metric; the corrected volume should have a higher SNR than the raw volume.
